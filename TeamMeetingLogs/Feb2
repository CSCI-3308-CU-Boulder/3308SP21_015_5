2/2/2021 Venkat- Allison, Brady, Abeal. 3:40-4pm
2/2 Meeting Summary

1. Talked about our potential project ideas. Came to the conclusion that Weather Predictor was a hard topic to integrate an interactive/front-end component.
2. Include a database component in the project. User logins, save user data.
3. Next Steps: Pick a project topic, so we can complete the project milestone. Figure out Design/Architecture of the project (i.e. which programming languages we want to use, but more importantly, how we want to structure our website/project.) For a social network, would we want to have friends (only friends can see posts) or followers (everyone can see posts).
4. Begin deciding which members of the team will do which tasks so we can start researching techniques. Play to strengths, but also build on areas we donâ€™t know much about.
