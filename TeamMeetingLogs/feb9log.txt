Meeting 3 notes

- The dummy sprint isn’t right, all jira stuff needs to be relevant to our project
- At the end of the sprint day, mark stuff done
- Start an actual sprint
- We'll start a sprint a week from now
- Do research on stuff we’ll need for the project even though we don’t have the technical skills yet
	   Ex: a toolbar 
- During the next project meeting time, put some backlog items in an epic
- Every US needs an epic
- Everyone needs a minimum of one US per sprint (or divide accordingly to the hours)
