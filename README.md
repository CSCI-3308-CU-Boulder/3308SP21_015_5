<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Making connections and finding a job is difficult these days. CareerNetwork is a web application designed to connect students to each other and potential employers. The application is a platform for students to search for jobs and showcase their accomplishments and skills via feed posts and for students and employers to contact one another either directly or through feed posts. <p>
	<p>Features of the website include the ability to register an account and login to an existing account. There is a newsfeed feature to display all posts from all users publicly. Users are able to connect with other users directly who have an account through an email client which includes all of their inputted information as well as an uploaded resume. The website also includes dark mode functionality for ease of use. User data and post data are both stored in a secure database.<p>
	We developed this project using an Agile project management methodology which was tracked using JIRA and used PostgreSQL, GitHub, VSCode, and Fiddle as tools for development. The website was deployed using LocalHost. The front-end was developed using HTML/CSS/Javascript, the database used was PostgreSQL, and NodeJS, Express, and RestAPI for the back-end.
